# Graphing Data using Google Chrome's Extension

This project will show you how to create a Google Chrome Extension to graph data from the TCP server.  Once you have cloned this repo run:

```sh
$ make 
```
Fire up 2 xterms and run the following command in the first xterm:

```sh
$ ./simpleOutPipe
```
and the following command in the second xterm:
```sh
$ python tcpSimpleServer.py
```

Then open up Google Chrome and add the Google Chrome Extension found in the ChromeExt folder.

You can get more information about these programs from [my blog](http://salimhaniff.net/blog/Graphing-Data-using-Google-Chromes-Extension#disqus_thread).
